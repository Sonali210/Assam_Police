<h1 align="center">AI-Based Smart Tracking System</h1></ br>

 ## :innocent: Tracking Solution </br>
Team PICODERS come up with the solution to the problem statement “Smart Movement tracking solution of People/Vehicles from Point A to point B” to the aid of the law enforcement officers of Assam. Road accidents are undoubtedly the most frequent happening cases and overall, the cause of the most damage. So alongwith tracking, we come up with smart tracking system that ensures safety on roads as well.

Our smart solution mainly comprises:

1.Vehicle tracking from point A to Point B</br>
2. Vehicle speed detection</br>
3. Automatic Number Plate Recognition</br>
4. Pedestrian detection</br>
5. Helmet detection</br>

## :handshake: Vehicle Tracking

## :bulb: Speed Detection
Our Artificially Intelligent Smart Tracking System uses object detection to detect the vehicles and measures the speed of vehicle passing through the area in just fraction of seconds.
We take two virtual points, distance between them is calculated using calibration. Then, we used the formula Speed=Distance/Time to calculate the speed. This system ensures that the vehicles do not cross a certain speed limit, to minimize accidents. If a vehicle is found to violate the speed limit, then our tracking system alerts immediately by sounding an alarm. 

## :star: Automatic Number Plate Recognition
It captures the vehicle's liscence plate accurately using Optical Character Reader (OCR) and can sends the information of defied immediately to the law enforcement agencies. Using Artificial Intelligence, we designed this system in such a way that it can keep count on the number of vehicles passing by an area. This helps in keeping track of traffic on a certain route. Combined with the presented vehicle detection and tracking methods, abnormal parking events and traffic jam events can be detected to obtain more abundant traffic information.  The smart system automatically identifies and captures any kind of violation of rules and can send the number plate data (primary key) wirelessly in an efficient manner. Our data can be uploaded securely in real-time to web browsers where authorized users can log in to their password-protected on-line accounts from anywhere and can take legal action against lawbreakers.

## :handshake: Pedestrian Detection
The system is capable of tracking pedestrian routes and ensure that they follow footpaths (to minimize the possibility of road accidents). In case they do not follow the rules, the Artificially Intelligent control system raises an alarm alerting to follow the correct paths. Alarm raised can either be visual or voice based. This will help in reducing the accident rates in the area. 

## :clap: Helmet Detection
our Smart System is trained to detect if the person riding the vehicle is wearing a helmet or not. A helmet aims to reduce the risk of serious head and brain injuries by reducing the impact of a force or collision to the head. So, this becomes a necessity to be looked into. Our Tracking system identifies such defied vehicles and can be made to send their information with the vehicle number online. This will help the authorities to take legal action against such law-breakers.
